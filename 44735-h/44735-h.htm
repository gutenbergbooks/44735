<p class="center">(<i>By our Special Expert, who has
been accorded the customary courtesy
extended to the Press.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p class="author">
<i>On board H.M.S. &mdash;&mdash;.<br />
---- the &mdash;th, 1895.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Forgive me for the vagueness
of my address, but it is the desire
of those in command that the
greatest secrecy should be observed
as to our movements.</p>

<p>"Are we the Blue Fleet or the
Red?" I asked only a few
moments ago of one of the chief
commanders.</p>

<p>"As you are the guest of the
Government," was the immediate
reply, "you will not be allowed
to pay your money&mdash;except indirectly
to the collector of Revenue;
but there is nothing to
prevent you from taking your
choice!"</p>

<p>From this response you will see
that there is a strong inclination
on the part of the authorities that
are to remain reticent. However,
it is only fair to say that the food
is excellent. Nothing could be
better than the wine; and the
view on the quarter deck is capital.
Still, this is scarcely an
account of naval man&oelig;uvring&mdash;now
is it?</p>

<p>Well, I think I may reveal this
much. There are two fleets&mdash;a
Red Fleet and a Blue Fleet. The
Red Fleet has a number of ships&mdash;so
has the Blue. Then the Red
Fleet tries to out-man&oelig;uvre the
Blue Fleet, and the Blue Fleet
returns the compliment. All this
takes place on the sea. No ship
is allowed to run on shore&mdash;unless
of course by force of circumstances
outside the control of the commander.
And when I had got as
far as this, I thought I would
make a further inquiry.</p>

<p>"I presume," said I, to one of
the chief officials, "that our object
is to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point I was interrupted.</p>

<p>"Pray ask no more," was the
prompt reply of the veteran I had
questioned. "Take my advice.
If you wish a question answered,
answer it for yourself. Arrange
in your own mind that 'Heads'
shall mean 'Yes,' and the reverse
a negative. Then toss."</p>

<p>And so now I am taking the
advice I have received. I have
spun my sixpence in the air. I
am to write no more to you. All
refuse to send my communications
for me. So I place this
document in a bottle and throw it
into the sea. You desired the
fullest information about the
naval man&oelig;uvres. Well&mdash;I wish
you may get it!</p>

that he may get his namesake's

<p class="ph4">RE-INCARNATION.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Have just been reading in the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> a wonderful
story called "A Re-Incarnation," by the author of "A Green
Carnation." He seems fond of carnations. Re-Incarnation and
Gre-Encarnation. Should have been in the exhibition of the National Carnation
Society at the Crystal Palace. His story tells how a man murdered
a white cat, and afterwards married its soul, re-incarnated in
the body of a young woman with "china-blue" eyes and a large fortune.
Marvellous! Must carefully avoid marrying young women
with "china-blue" eyes and large fortunes, though the latter might
not be so harmful.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;That theory of re-incarnation impresses me wonderfully.
Think about it all night. In the silent darkness remember that I
once stamped on a black beetle. My nurse called it "a black
beadle." Think of this with horror. Will it come back to murder
me? Terrible! Get up still nervous. Must go out into the air and
sunlight, to dispel my gloomy thoughts. Stroll along Piccadilly.
To avoid a shower step into the Burlington Arcade. Heavens, what
is that by the entrance? It is a man in black&mdash;a black beadle!
Gaze at him aghast. It has come back, the soul of that harmless
crawling thing which I crushed in my boyhood, and now&mdash;&mdash;Fly
while there is yet time! Ha! I am safe at home at last.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Have now no doubt of this marvellous theory. It
is probable that re-incarnation may sometimes go the other way.
Will investigate at the Zoological Gardens. Directly I see the
largest elephant I recognise my late mother-in-law. The large,
heavy form, the habit of trampling obstacles under foot&mdash;obstacles
such as myself&mdash;the very cap-strings, now become ears flapping in
the wind, all are there. She always poked her nose into everything,
and she does it now. What a proboscis she has! Must tell the
keeper the real truth to prevent mishaps. Tell him confidentially.
He grins. Assure him that I am quite serious. He leads me gently
by the arm to the exit, where the turnstile only turns one way, and
advises me to go home at once.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Fresh proofs every hour. Have just seen an omnibus
horse, with the long face, the great yellow teeth and the general
expression of my uncle's second wife. Greatly overcome, seek rest
and refreshment in my club. What is that having lunch over there?
Don't tell me it is an old gentleman with white hair and mild eyes.
No! It is my first rabbit, which died of starvation through my
carelessness. See, he is hungrily munching a lettuce! That is
conclusive.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;My great work on <i>Re-Incarnation</i> begun to-day. It
will astonish the world, for it is all true. By why have my friends
asked those two doctors to call? There is nothing the matter with
me. The two fools say I ought to give up all writing and keep quite
quiet in the country. Explain that it is impossible. They insist
with gentle firmness. Tell them I have no doubt they are the two
leeches I once took from the bowl at the chemists and put on my
little sister's neck, whence they were removed by the nurse and
ruthlessly slaughtered.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;My diary has been interrupted, for I have been moving
to this hydropathic establishment, as those doctors called it, at
Colney Hatch. I don't like the place. Most of the visitors seem
mad. But probably many of these water-drinkers are mad.
Wouldn't they be surprised if they knew who I really am? Ha, ha!
It will make a nice summer correspondence for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.
To-morrow I will write to that paper stating the actual facts.
I also am re-incarnated. I am, or rather I was, the Great Sea
Serpent.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. R.</span> was very sorry that the clergyman of her parish had been
compelled to leave. "You see," she said, "the poor man fell off his
bicycle, and his doctor has told him that for some time he must try
an incumbent position. So he has gone away for another cure."</p>

<p class="ph4">ELECTION NOTES FROM THE WEST.</p>

<p>This is how the <i>Western Daily Mercury</i>
describes "the fight"&mdash;before it began. "The
electoral battle continues, but it is a most unequal
contest. The Tories have been out-generalled,
outman&oelig;uvred, and outclassed.
They are like the Chinese fleet at Yalu, stolid
and uncertain, whilst the Liberals are sailing
round them, pouring into them a withering
fire from quick-firing guns, sweeping away
masts and signal-yards, and scattering their
crews in confusion. The fire from the Tories
is intermittent, insufficient, and badly directed.
It is doing very little harm."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>This is quite a gem of nautical description.
Such as might justly be expected from a great
naval port like Plymouth, which is the home
of the <i>Mercury</i>. The chief beauty of it,
moreover, is that it will serve again to describe
the battle&mdash;when it is finished ("after the
poll"), the only alteration necessary being a
transposition of the two words Tories and
Liberals.</p>

<p class="ph4">SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Another Irish Party!</span>&mdash;The
snakes are coming back to Ireland!
In a Cork paper we read the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Cornelius Donovan</span>, while
crossing a grass field near Blarney,
encountered a snake, which at first he
believed to be an eel, and struck it
with his walking stick. Having killed
the reptile, he discovered it was a
snake, measuring 3 feet 9 inches.</p></blockquote>

<p>Evidently a political omen of
some kind, this return of the
emigrants to Erin. What does
it portend? Mr. <span class="sc">M-rl-y</span>, on being
consulted, is "inclined to fancy
that the Cork snake is a herald
of Coercion, and shows that the
venom of Dublin Castle will soon
be at work." Mr. <span class="sc">G. B-lf-r</span>, on
the other hand, says that "the
return of general confidence at the
advent of a Unionist Government,
and a really capable Irish Secretary,
has never been better exemplified.
Even the reptiles are
not afraid now to try Ireland as
a place of residence!" And Mr.
<span class="sc">J-st-n M'C-rthy</span> has no doubt
at all that "the incident is another
sign of the growing Irish spirit of
disunion. Did not St. Patrick
banish snakes from Ireland? And
ought not snakes, if they are
worthy of the name of patriots,
to obey St. P., and stay away?
Well, they are returning, and
defying St. P.&mdash;just as <span class="sc">R-dm-nd</span>
defies <i>me!</i> And," added the
eminent leader, meditatively,
"I've often thought there was a
good deal of the eel about him, too."</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Peers are Cheap To-day.</span>"&mdash;From

he would make every man in that
meeting a peer, so that they should
go to the Lords and resolve upon their
abolition.</p></blockquote>

<p>Prodigious! But how is the
Bailie going to proceed? Bring
in a "Bill of Wright's" when he
has got his new nobility ensconced
in the Gilded Chamber? And
suppose the Bailie's peers decline

<p>Despite the unfavourable weather, Lady <span class="sc">Tipton's</span> garden-party
on Wednesday was a great success. Strawberry-picking was the
principal amusement, and some well-known performers were present.
Miss <span class="sc">De Mure</span>, as usual, beat all her rivals, but the Bishop of
<span class="sc">Pulborough</span> was only half-a-basket behind. Like most of her
friends, Lady <span class="sc">Tipton</span> has now converted all her croquet and tennis
lawns into fruit-beds.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lord Grayson</span> is entertaining a large party of friends for bird-scaring
this week. Starlings are somewhat scarce this year, but
sparrows are very plentiful and strong on the wing. Some capital
sport was enjoyed over these well-known fields last week, and the
host (who used a blunderbuss manufactured by Messrs. <span class="sc">Murdey</span>) is
credited with having frightened away about 5000 brace in a single
day.</p>

<p><i>Truth</i> is quite wrong in stating that the Marquis of <span class="sc">Coombe</span>
intends to sell his well-known potato-patch in Hammersmith. On
the contrary, he has just laid down two dozen new plants. It is
true, however, that several of the smartest people are growing
onions instead of potatoes this year.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>As the show-season will soon be with us again, it may be well to
remark that the committees should make certain of the genuine
character of the exhibits. It would be disgraceful were there to be
any repetition of such a scandal as occurred last autumn at a leading
exhibition, when it was discovered that the apples belonging to a
certain lady of title, to which the prize already had been awarded,
owed their brilliant appearance to the fact that her Grace had tinted
them with water-colours.</p>

<p>The Inter-'Varsity ploughing competition takes place at Lord's on
Friday. The Cambridge men are perhaps the favourites at present,
but, though they have undoubtedly done some fast times, their
furrows are apt to be very erratic. Still, under Farmer <span class="sc">Hodge's</span>
able coaching, they may be expected to improve greatly in the next
few days.</p>

<p>Some of the papers have been making merry over the attempts to
start butter-making clubs among the poorer classes. It is true that
butter-making has been considered hitherto almost exclusively a
rich man's recreation; but I do not see why the hard-working
labourer, who has been toiling at golf or polo all day, should not be
allowed to amuse himself with this healthy pastime in the evening,
just as much as his superiors in social station.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>À propos</i> of butter-making, I hear that a testimonial is to be
presented to Mr. <span class="sc">Aylesbury</span>, who has now captained his county
team for some years. Of his all-round skill it is needless to speak;
he is a useful change churner, and he had far the highest patting
average last season.</p>

<p class="center">Mr. Speaker Gully.</p></div>


<p>Now the new House of Commons is complete, and Members are
preparing to meet for their first Session, the question of who is to be
Speaker comes to the front. <i>Mr. Punch</i> is pleased to observe the
growing conviction in both political camps that there really is no
question on the subject. Had Mr. <span class="sc">Gully</span> performed the duties of
Speaker with merely average capacity, the House of Commons,
mindful of its highest traditions, would have been slow to celebrate
a party victory at the polls by dispossessing him in favour of a
nominee of the new majority. His marked success happily makes
such action more than ever improbable.</p>

<p>His position was made exceptionally difficult by the circumstances
of the day. Elected by a narrow majority, he succeeded the greatest
Speaker of modern times. The fierce light that beats on the
Speaker's chair was intensified by the inevitable contrast between
the new occupant and the stately figure long familiar to the House.
From the first Mr. <span class="sc">Gully</span> wisely refrained from even approach to
imitation of the manner of Mr. <span class="sc">Peel</span>. That was a thing apart, like
the bow of Ulysses. The new Speaker was simply himself; and the
House of Commons, the keenest, swiftest, fairest judge of character
in the world, was delighted to find in him perfect equanimity of
temper, a judicial mind, unfailing readiness in emergency, and a
quite surprising knowledge of the intricacies of procedure.</p>

<p>During his brief tenure of office Mr. <span class="sc">Gully</span> was more than once
suddenly faced by a knotty point that might reasonably have been
expected to baffle a 'prentice hand. Never on these occasions has he
failed. Such rare aptitude displayed at the outset of a career
promises the fullness of perfection when, strengthened and sustained
by the unanimous vote of a new Parliament, the Speaker
resumes his work.</p>

couldn't get attended to at the Stores, or <i>vice versâ</i> by a counter-jumper

<p>End of operatic season, and a fine season too. The <span class="sc">Patti</span> nights
exceptionally brilliant. <span class="sc">De Reszke</span> <i>frères</i>, the accomplished Bicycling
Brothers, did not appear, but Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> sang the
old song "<i>We're going to do without them</i>" and did so, uncommonly
well. <span class="sc">Maurel</span>, <span class="sc">Ancona</span>, <span class="sc">Plançon</span>, were
bright particular stars; while <span class="sc">Melba</span>
suddenly shone forth as Comet with
magnificent tail, <i>i.e.</i> a great following.
<span class="sc">Calvé</span> held her own against all comers:
and, as <i>Santuzza</i>, it was a case of
"honours divided" with Mdme. <span class="sc">Bellincioni</span>,
who, it must not be forgotten,
was the original of the part. The
Beneficent <span class="sc">Bauermeister</span>, of talent unlimited,
has shown that "woman," like
man, "in <i>her</i> time can play many parts."
Mlle. <span class="sc">Bauermeister</span> has played them;
and all equally well.</p>



<p>So farewell Operatics till next year,
when <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> need fear no
storms, if still provided with his lightning
Conductors <span class="sc">Bevignani</span>, <span class="sc">Mancinelli</span> &amp; Co. Nor need the
Liberal-Conservative <span class="sc">Druriolanus Operaticus</span> think of having to
reckon with any formidable rivalry, should the utterly improbable
happen and a new Opposition Opera be started. Why two Opera
Houses cannot succeed in London may be a problem, but hitherto it is

<p class="ph4">OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</p>

<p>To recommend <i>Lyre and Lancet</i> to readers
of <i>Punch</i> is to preach to the converted, and,
as Sir <span class="sc">William Harcourt</span> said when he
opened his election campaign in Derby, that
is a work of supererogation. There is, however,
this new thing to be said, that <span class="sc">Smith,
Elder &amp; Co.</span>, including the work in their
Novel Series, have presented it in dainty
form, and have preserved Mr. <span class="sc">Partridge's</span>
illustrations. My Baronite has read it through
again with increased admiration for the
perilous audacity of the plot, the skill with
which it is worked out, and the many felicities
of the phrasing. It would be so easy to
spoil it by a coarse or slovenly touch. In no
scene of the breathless drama does Mr.
<span class="sc">Anstey's</span> hand forget its cunning.</p>

<p>The larger number of the verses that make
up the little volume <span class="sc">Smith, Elder &amp; Co.</span>
publish under the title <i>Tillers of the Sand</i>
have, Mr. <span class="sc">Owen Seaman</span> states in his preface,
appeared in the <i>National Observer</i>. Whilst
they are above the average of the cleverness
of that really smart journal, they are tainted
by its besetting sin. Purporting to present
"a fitful record of the <span class="sc">Rosebery</span> Administration,"
the recorder finds it all very bad.
This is hard on the late Government, but it
is harder still on the clever versifier. True
art requires light and shade, and here is
none. Appearing week by week the pungent
admixtures were passable, were even titillating.
But the monotony of vituperation, however
cleverly compounded, grows a little
wearisome, even in a volume that does not
much exceed a hundred pages. My Baronite
likes best "The Lament of the Macgregor,"
not because its literary style is more masterly
than that of its companion verse, but because
its fun is less acrid. The rest, with
significant exception of two pieces that appeared
in these pages, is too hotly spiced
with <span class="sc">Ashmead-Bartlettism</span> to please one
who looks to Mr. <span class="sc">Seaman</span> for the wine of
scholarly verse and finds the vinegar of election
squibs.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Picked up in the neighbourhood of Dorchester House</i>)</p>

<p>Before leaving England I finish this book. I have seen much
and would have liked to see more. It was a great disappointment
to me that the Polytechnic had changed its character. It was the
dream of my childhood to be present at a lecture "Illustrated with
brilliant experiments." Still the British Museum was a very good
substitute. Then I was pleased with the Imperial Institute, and
appreciated <span class="sc">Strauss's</span> band. Although I have yet to learn what the
latter had to do with the spread of the British Dominion. And I was
delighted with the State Balls and the Ascot races. I was pleased, too,
with my visit to the Board School. And there seemed to be much
doing in the Houses of Parliament. But what struck me most of all
was the great prosperity I noticed everywhere. There is no poverty
in England. All is rich. Everyone is great. There are none who
are not powerful; it is marvellous, but true. I should like to
return to this great country to learn a little more. I have not yet seen
a paper printed. I have not dined at the table of those who are
responsible for the gaiety of nations. I have not watched the manufacture
of a clock. I have not examined waxworks. I have not
risen in the air in a balloon, nor sunk below the level of the sea in a
diving-bell. But all this pleasure can wait till I pay England a
second visit. And I am pleased to find that certain places are myths,
the more especially as these places were said to be "disgraces to
civilization." There is no East End. There are no prisons. Poverty
is a word that has become obsolete. Everyone is satisfied. A strike
never happens because all Englishmen are contented. This is the
lesson that I have learned at the hands of the great British Government.
It is strange, but undoubtedly true, that the English nation
has no "seamy side." So I leave the country of prosperous content
with a salaam of heart-felt respect. And now for Paris, with its
wicked distractions. I hope I may survive. In the meanwhile
Britannia, Brave, Brilliant, Beautiful and Beneficial, farewell!</p>

<p class="ph4">GOOD NEWS, AND STRANGE TOO!</p>

<p>The Northern Railway Company of France, as the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i> informs us, has decided to spend four millions of francs
in improving its rolling-stock. This move ought to send up all its
"stock" in the market. Also there is to be a train of an entirely
new pattern, replete with every convenience, running in correspondence
with the London Chatham and Dover Company's most
convenient continental service. This is first-class (and second also)
news for persons about to travel. The <i>D. T.</i> further says that "the
adoption of bogies will make the running easy." Good gracious!
The cutting and running would come quite naturally to most of the
passengers on beholding only one "bogey"; but when it comes to
"bogies," there would be a general stampede! Very kind of the
Northern to "adopt" bogies. Some poor little orphan bogies, left at
the door of a Bogey-Foundling Hospital, deserted by their ghostly
and unnatural parents, but "adopted" by the spirited Great
Northern of France! "Hush! Hush, Hush, it is the Bogey Train!"
But no tricks on travellers, spirited Great Northern of France.</p>

<p class="ph4">ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</p>

<p>I spoke last week of the General Election, more particularly with
regard to its influence on the speakers who take part in it. A treatise
on this aspect of the matter has yet to be written. One of the main
points to be determined will be the amount of influence exercised by
the speech, not on its hearers, but on the speaker himself.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Nothing is more remarkable than the rapidity and definiteness
with which a speaker's opinions crystallise during the course of a
speech. Let us assume, for example, that a Radical candidate has
been approached on the subject of an Eight Hours Bill, and, in order
to gain time, has promised to deal with it in his next speech, at the
same time giving an assurance of general
sympathy. Probably he has not thought
much about the question before. In the
evening he will speak upon it; and suddenly,
to his own intense surprise, he will
find himself declaring that all legislation
will be vain, all social effort fruitless, until
the load of toil that presses on the mass of
his fellow-countrymen is lightened, and
a universal Eight Hours Bill is carried
through both Houses.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Or again, a Conservative is confronted
with the question of old-age pensions. Precisely
the same process takes place, and
under the necessity of convincing himself,
while endeavouring to convince and to
please his audience, he will vow never to
cease his efforts in support of Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>
until a general system of State pensions
for the aged is established throughout
the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>So it is with votes of thanks and laudatory
speeches of all kinds. If you have to
move a vote of thanks to A., a politician
whom you do not specially admire, the odds
are about ten to one that you will describe him as a great statesman,
a profound thinker, an eloquent orator, and the man of the future.
All this may be due to your having embarked on a rhetorical period
which required more words than you had prepared yourself to supply;
and in the agitation of filling up the gap, and rounding off the period,
you say what you had not the remotest intention of saying when you
got on to your legs. Hence come in after years parallel columns, and
aggravating charges of inconsistency.</p>

<p>It was roses, roses all the way. But that was some time ago in
the case of Mr. <span class="sc">Isaac Hoyle</span>, late Liberal Member for the Heywood
Division of Lancashire. He was asked to support Mr. <span class="sc">Snape</span> the
Liberal Candidate at this election, but he refused to "take any part
in sending Mr. <span class="sc">Snape</span> to Parliament, charged with duties for which,
as I think, his votes show he has no qualification." The receipt
of this letter caused the greatest excitement in the Division,
and at the Heywood Reform Club Mr. <span class="sc">Hoyle's</span> portrait has
been smashed to pieces and thrown out of the building. It is
stated also that his subscriptions are being returned. Clearly a case
of adding Hoyle to the flames of controversy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Thomas Milvain</span>, the Conservative who vainly endeavoured to
oust Sir <span class="sc">Wilfrid Lawson</span> from the Cockermouth Division, was once
a great boxer&mdash;a heavy-weight champion amongst amateurs, if my
memory serves me. In the course of his late contest he addressed a
hostile meeting at Dearham. Many questions were put to him. One
was, "What weight was ta when thoo was a boxer?" Mr.
<span class="sc">Milvain's</span> answer was, "I was 13 st. 8 lb. That was twenty-eight
years ago, and I have not had the gloves on since." (<i>Laughter and
cheers, and a Voice</i>: "<i>Would you like to have them on now?</i>") "I
am quite prepared to give any of you a turn, if you want one."
(<i>Great laughter and cheers.</i>)</p>

<p>In a provincial contemporary I find the following startling information,
under the heading, "Mothers of Great Men." <span class="sc">Schumann's</span>
mother was gifted in music; <span class="sc">Chopin's</span> mother, like himself, was
very delicate; <span class="sc">Wordsworth's</span> mother had a character as peculiar as
that of her gifted son; <span class="sc">Raleigh</span> said that he owed all his politeness
of deportment to his mother. There are other statements about other
mothers, but those I have quoted may suffice in the meantime. What
I want to know is why any reasonable human being should care, or
be supposed to care, about these ridiculous scraps of information collected
from a rubbish-heap of useless knowledge. Here is another
that I cannot leave out: <span class="sc">Haydn</span> dedicated one of his most important
instrumental compositions to his mother. Amazing.</p>

<p>In the parish of Swaffham Bulbeck (Ph&oelig;bus, what a name!) there
are apparently two bridges. At the adjourned quarterly meeting of
the Parish Council the other day, Mr. <span class="sc">C. P. Fyson</span> in the chair, "it
was reported that Bridge No. 1 required to
be re-built.... The Chairman reported
Bridge No. 2 required the same treatment,
and eventually the whole matter was adjourned"&mdash;presumably
in the hope that in
the interval the bridges would rebuild
themselves.</p>

<p class="ph4">HOW I LOST MY POLL.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. Punch, Honoured Sir</span>,&mdash;By way of
supplementing efforts of <i>Daily Chroncile</i> to
obtain authorised statements showing cause
for defeat of certain distinguished candidates,
have secured following satisfactory
explanations, for authenticity of which I
have pleasure in vouching. Have suppressed
names of men and places, thus sacrificing
verisimilitude on altar of discretion.</p>

<p>A. explains:&mdash;Opponent started with every
natural advantage, having only appeared in
constituency three weeks and two days ago,
and being entirely unknown. (<i>Omne ignotum
pro benefico.</i>) I, on other hand, had
been on spot for five-and-twenty years, and
was <i>only two well known</i>.</p>

<p>B. explains:&mdash;Attribute my defeat (by
exactly 4529 votes) to over-confidence on part of my supporters.
Seems that recollection of ample margin of two (one voting-paper
disputed) by which I was returned to late Parliament produced reckless
and culpable apathy.</p>

<p>C. explains:&mdash;Mistake to suppose that Local or any other Veto had
appreciable bearing on result of election. Fact is that opposition
chartered every available traction-engine to bring up rural electorate.
All other traffic practically suspended. Terrorised owners refused to
risk their stables in unequal struggle. Was reduced to average of one
horse a piece for my four-in-hands. Also other man's wife prettier
than mine.</p>

<p>D. explains:&mdash;Am author of many standard works of blood-curdling
adventure, largely among blacks. Found myself besieged one day in
headquarters by what I took to be murderous contingent of enemy.
In all my books of fiction, hero would have hacked his way through
midst, if only with open penknife. Stern reality quite a different
matter. Fell back upon services of local fire-brigade. Turned out
afterwards that crowd actually consisted of admiring readers and
political friends all eager to draw me, by pardonable ruse, into display
of heroic qualities as depicted in my popular writings. Disillusioned
by me, and damped by fire-brigade, mob went off and voted for other
side.</p>

<p>E. explains:&mdash;Had Women's Suffrage existed, am confident should
have been returned by handsome majority, being single and bit of an
Adonis. As it was, fatal gift for attracting feminine attention
alienated younger male electors. Other candidate solid family man
without physical charm. Has been said that beauty is a curse. In
own case must unhesitatingly admit soft impeachment.</p>

<p>F. explains:&mdash;It arose in this way. Had arranged beforehand
that pole of carriage should snap in two during ascent of heavy
incline in very heart of borough, idea being that partisans would be
compelled to un-horse vehicle and personally propel it along in semi-triumphal
progress. All went well till it came to pushing. Then
was seen that weight of fellow-passengers (three obese stump-orators
sent down by Caucus) overtaxed strength of small body of supporters,
men remarkable for intellectual perspicuity rather than
brute force. Notwithstanding laudable efforts, carriage receded,
slowly at first, then, gaining impetus, rushed with incredible speed
full into plate-glass window of <span class="sc">Mayor's</span> grocery-store. Self and all
three orators bled profusely. Should add that <span class="sc">Mayor</span> was exceedingly
popular politician of heterodox views. Cause of my Party
completely ruined by shocking fiasco.</p>

<p>Kindly observe, dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, how insignificant a part seems
to have been played in above elections by great and vital questions of
day. Let me hear if you want any more of these explanations. Cost
me nothing.</p>
